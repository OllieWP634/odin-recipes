    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        A full breakfast or fry-up is a substantial cooked breakfast meal often 
        served in Britain and Ireland. Depending on the region, it may also be 
        referred to as a full English, a full Irish, full Scottish, full 
        Welsh or Ulster fry. The fried breakfast became popular in Great 
        Britain and Ireland during the Victorian era; while the term "full breakfast" 
        does not appear, a breakfast of "fried ham and eggs" is in Isabella Beeton's 
        Book of Household Management (1861).
