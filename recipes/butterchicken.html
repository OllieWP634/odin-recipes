    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Butter chicken is a type of curry made from chicken cooked in a spiced
        tomato and butter (makhan)-based gravy. The gravy is typically known 
        for its rich texture. It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses 
        a tomato paste. The dish originates in Delhi, India.
