        <li>
            Ensure pan is <em>incredibly</em> hot, add oil of choice,
            then begin seering the steak. Do not turn over until a

        </li>
        <li>
            Flip the steak over, add spring onions to

            Remove the steak from the pan and allow to rest for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Crack an egg on a flat surface, add to the pan and allow it to
            cook while the steak rests.
        </li>

            Once the egg has been cooked, chop and plate the 
            steak and eggs!
